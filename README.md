To run the project, run these commands in your terminal:

```console
npm install
npm start
```

It's important to notice that this setup expects that the app is running as `http://localhost:3000/` and the API at `http://localhost:5500/`, thus it's extremely important to change the code after assigning a domain to each of those.
To format the entire folder with prettier run: `npx prettier --write .`
