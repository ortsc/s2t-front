              Young professionals go through the everyday pain of having to
              demonstrate their skills to the market without having the formal
              means to do so. Either they lack certification or their skillset
              doesn't fit the imposed requirements. Quite often, the needs of
              the market are not for a highly skilled professional who has
              undertaken a tortuous certification process, but for a technician
              with a very specific talent. That's where <mark>Skill2Token</mark>{" "}
              comes in.

              When someone applies for a token with their skill portfolio, the
              voting process that lasts 24 hours begins, and anyone with an{" "}
              <mark>$S2T</mark> token can approve or deny the application. In
              the end, the losing side tokens (the one with the fewer coins
              invested) are divided proportionally between the winner side. This
              approach has an extensive list of benefits, such as
              decentralization, transparency, community power, and the incentive
              to think well before voting, so as not to lose all the coins you
              invested.

              A whitelist is a list of users allowed to do something before the

              can buy <mark>$S2T</mark> tokens before anyone else and,
